    <h2>Important Information</h2>
    <p>
        Some online stores use lazy loading for their content, which makes tools like 
        <em>BeautifulSoup</em> less effective. An alternative approach would be to use <em>Selenium</em> or other 
        interface automation tools to handle dynamically loaded content. However, this project prioritizes learning, 
        and the use of <em>BeautifulSoup</em> is intentional for educational purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other stores feature dynamic pricing that varies over time, making direct comparisons more challenging. Despite this, they are included due to the limited availability of alternative options.

        Also, there are shops, such as <strong>PcComponentes</strong> and <strong>ElCorteInglés</strong>, which return a 
        <code>403 Forbidden</code> response when accessed via Python's HTTP libraries.
